        Hi there! It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Harsh, and I'm a 
MERN stack developer. I specialize in working with MongoDB, 
Express.js, React, and Node.js.
With a strong emphasis on clean code, problem-solving, and 
user-friendly design, I approach every project with a dedication 
to delivering high-quality results.
